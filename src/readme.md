Welcome to the **VPS-Guides** collection. if you are planning to or currently trying to set up your own VPS and make yourself independant of big, centralized corporations, this collection of in-depth guides will assist you from the very start all the way to the setup apps. the guides not only cover the actual setup instructions, but also explanations what the scripts to, and even details regarding **"server hardening"**, meaning protecting your server and the apps on it against outside attacks.

don't fret if you're a beginner and have barely, or even never, used linux or administrated a server. these guides start with beginners in mind and only slowly get more fast-paced. you'll learn a lot while following the instructions!

if you do not yet have a VPS, or another kind of server that you want to run your apps on, proceed to the "**First Steps**" category. Should you already have the infrastructure, either skip ahead to the app you want to set up, or skim the introductionary guides and check the security steps to make sure you've done all you can to protect your server.
